# MSSRC: Multivariate Signal-Separation using Reservoir Computing

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the algorithm for multivariate signal denoising using reservoir computing.

MSSRC (Multivariate Signal-Separation using Reservoir Computing) is an unsupervised approach for denoising multivariate signals that are contaminated by spatially correlated intensive noise. The method works successfully for various multivariate signals, including chaotic signals and highly oscillating sinusoidal signals.
